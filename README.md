# 311

For this project I wanted to look at 311 data from New York City to see how response times to 311 calls vary by borough. I chose to focus on 311 calls from 2019 so that the results and graphical displays would be most relevant and up to date. 311 calls reflect the daily struggles of New Yorkers. The service provides a catchall outlet for locals to make non-criminal complaints.
To narrow the scope of the project I investigated mostly 311 calls that were classified by the 311 operator as being assigned to the NYPD. This allowed for a finer level of discrimination.

Staten Island and The Bronx stand out as boroughs that have long ticket times.
